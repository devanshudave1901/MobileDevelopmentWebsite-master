                    <b> Mobile Development – Mobile Operating System</b><br/><br/>
                        
                        •	When we go to the shop for purchasing the mobile device, now a days most common question we hear is “Do you prefer android or IOS?”. Now the question arises, what is exactly android and IOS. What’s the point to ask?. Well, to answer this question we have to dig more into the dept. But in short, Android and IOS are the part of types from many in mobile Operating systems. <br/>They are the main part which can change the user experience to use Mobile device. Its also a path between software and hardware part of the mobile device. <br/><br/><br/>
                        •	Mobile Device is used in day-to-day life. From small things to big, mobiles have become the most important part of our life. To run the mobile device OS which is also known as Operating System is required. OS is very important part of the mobile device. Mostly Applications which run on the mobile is with the help of the OS present in the device. They are also known as communicator between software and hardware.<br/><br/>
                        •	 There are various types of OS. But the two famous OS are Android and IOS. Most of the manufacturing companies have their own OS. Android devices (many manufacturing companies) have android OS. For example, Apple mobile phones have their own IOS which helps to run the iPhone devices. Android OS is used in Android devices like Samsung, Oppo, Vivo, MI etc.<br/><br/>
                        •	 There are many advantages of Mobile Operating system. Along with that where there are advantages there are also disadvantages. <br/>
    
                    </p>
                    <table class="table table-bordered">

                            <td>Operating System helps us to run the mobile devices. 
                                Or with the help of OS, we can use Mobile device in an 
                                easy way in day-to-day life</td>
                            <td>Costly. One of the disadvantage is that it is costly. 
                                Though OS is an open source, but it costs the companies more.
                                According to the survey, it states that the specific OS is costing providers more to service.</td>

                        <tr>
                            <td>Second Advantage is Security. Every OS provides their own security to protect the data  <br/>and has different ways to defend the hacking on mobile devices.
                                <br/> For example, according to what I heard or experienced,<br/> Apple doesn’t allow many features ( apps or websites to access) in compared to android.<br/>
                                Every operating system provides the security, IOS is considered as the most secured OS than any other.
                                <br/>   “ According to Kaspersky Labs, nearly 1/3 of all mobile malware infections come from malicious SMS messages aimed at stealing personal information or money from people’s accounts. <br/>“ IOS secures the mobile device more than Android.
                                As mentioned above, IOS secures and restricts the activity that is a threat than android.”</td>
                            <td>  Complexity -  Various systems uses many languages in backend to run the OS on mobile devices. 
                                <br/>  Like C++, Java, Kotlin etc. and can not be understood by any non-programmers.</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>
                                User Friendly – Though having GUI interface costs more and can be
                                considered as a disadvantage. <br/>But that interface is a user friendly is considered as an advantage. 
                                <br/> It gives more advantage to seniors as GUI is friendly, it will be
                                easy for seniors to use and avoid loneliness.
                            </td>
                            <td>
                                Virus Attacks -  Nothing in the world is 100% perfect.  
                                When any downloads the stuff from third part websites like downloads YouTube 
                                videos from third party website increases the risk of virus attacks. 
                            </td>

                                Multi-tasking – We all know how busy we are and need to work on different things at once. 
                                <br/>For example, messaging, calling, running apps simultaneously.
                                <br/>Operating system gives the advantage to work simultaneously and helps our day-to-day life to become easy.
